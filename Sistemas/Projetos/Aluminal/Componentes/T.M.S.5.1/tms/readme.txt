Note about GDI+
---------------
The TMS Component Pack requires GDI+ to be installed on the development system.
The GDI+ API is used for complex gradient drawing antialiasing, PNG image support
with alpha transparency.

GDI+ might not be installed by default on your system. You can obtain a separate
GDI+ distribution from

http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=6A63AB9C-DF12-4D41-933C-BE590FEAA05A&displaylang=en

GDI+ is currently only required by following components: 

Always used in : TAdvToolBar, TAdOfficeHint, TAdvGlowButton, AdvCircularProgress, AdvSelectors 
Optionally used in : TAdvStringGrid,TAdvColumnGrid,TDBAdvGrid

Only when these components are used in your application, it might be necessary
to redistribute the GDI+ DLL with your application.

Note that GDI+ use can be disabled for TAdvStringGrid, TAdvColumnGrid,TDBAdvGrid.
To do this, open TMSDEFS.INC and comment the line {$DEFINE TMSGDIPLUS}


Note about using GDI+ with C++Builder
-------------------------------------
When using components that use GDI+, make sure that your app's main CPP file
includes the line:

#pragma link "gdiplus.lib"


Note about ADO support
----------------------
To use the TDBAdvGrid v2.0 component for ADO databases with dataset
sorts triggered from the grid, remove the line

{$DEFINE TMSNOADO}

from the file TMSDEFS.INC


Note about XP theme support for C++Builder 6
--------------------------------------------
An issue in the uxtheme.h file that is included with C++Builder 6
will cause problems when using TMS Components that include XP theme
support. The TMS Component Pack distribution contains a fixed uxtheme.h
file to solve this. Please copy this to ther {$BCB}\Include folder.


Note about TDBAdvStringGrid v1.7 / TDBAdvGrid v2.0
--------------------------------------------------

TDBAdvGrid v2.0 replaces TDBAdvStringGrid. By default TDBAdvStringGrid is no longer installed
as for new projects TDBAdvGrid v2.0 is the recommended component. 

TDBAdvStringGrid v1.7 is still included in the TMS Component Pack Pro distribution for
backwards compatibility. TDBAdvStringGrid will remain included in the TMS Component Pack Pro.
To avoid confusion for new users, it is only no longer installed on the component palette
by default.
